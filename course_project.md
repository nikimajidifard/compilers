<p style="font-size:35px;">programming project:</p>
Compiler construction for MiniJava<br>
<p style="font-size:35px;">description:</p>
The project is done individually or in groups of two or three students (recommended).<br>
You do not need to decide in advance how ambitious you will be; instead you should finish each stage
before you attempt an extension.<br>
Part of the goal of a project course like this is that you shall deliver working code on time. Thus,
credits will be awarded for working extensions submitted before the deadline.<br>
GOOD LUCK.<br>
