Programming Project:
Compiler construction for MiniJava
Description:
The project is done individually or in groups of two or three students (recommended).
You do not need to decide in advance how ambitious you will be; instead you should finish each stage
before you attempt an extension.
Part of the goal of a project course like this is that you shall deliver working code on time. Thus,
credits will be awarded for working extensions submitted before the deadline.
GOOD LUCK.
